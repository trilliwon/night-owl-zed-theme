# Night Owl for Zed

A Zed theme for the night owls out there. Fine-tuned for those of us who like to code late into the night. Color choices have taken into consideration what is accessible to people with colorblindness and in low-light circumstances. Decisions were also based on meaningful contrast for reading comprehension and for optimal razzle dazzle.

Ported from Sarah Drasner's [Night Owl VS Code theme](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme).
